# What it Does?

The Dataset contains the name of the available faculties, their category, priority rank(Associate Professor-1,Assistant Professor-2,Professor-3) which is assigned based on the assumption that the faculty who is neither at the higher position nor the lower position is both readily available as well as experienced to teach too, so they are given 1st priority. Assistant professors generally have less commitments compared to their seniors, and are also looking out to expand their exxperience, so they are given 2nd priority.Professors usually tend to be more busy with many commitments due to their seniority, so they are given the least priority.

Each faculty have given their priority of subjects to teach in order.

Based on the above said preconditions, this model will assign one faculty to each subjects.

In our case, we have 9 available faculties for teaching 9 department subjects, each of them with different seniority and different preferences.

This model can be extended too, based on the requiremenet by changing the contents of the dataset.
